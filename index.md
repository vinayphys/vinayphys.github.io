# Welcome

I am a PhD Candidate in Physics at <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in">The Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in/pinaki_chaudhuri">Pinaki Chaudhuri</a>.

# Research Interests
I am primarily interested in studying the dynamics of glass forming liquids. In particular, we are studying the response of a model glass-former under thermal perturbation using the techniques of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. I am also interested in complex systems and active systems. For more details see what I'm doing now.


# Academics
Current Designation: Senior Research Fellow (Theoretical Physics)

Education:
