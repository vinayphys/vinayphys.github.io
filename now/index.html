<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> July 3rd, 2017</p>
<p>These days I am studying the response of a model glass-former under thermal perturbation using the techniques of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. For performing the simulations I use the <a class="reference external" href="https://hpc.imsc.res.in/">High Performance Computing</a> facility available at IMSc. The institue has a very good Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics group working on a variety of problems. The members of the group also work on many problems which are at the intersection of Physics and Biology.</p>

<h2><strong>What is Glass?</strong></h2>
<p>Liquids at temperatures below their melting points are called supercooled liquids. As a supercooled liquid is cooled to lower temperatures, its viscosity increases and the molecular motion becomes slower. At some temperature (called glass transition temperature Tg ) the molecules will be moving so slowly that they do not have a chance to rearrange significantly before the temperature is lowered further. As a result, the experimentally observed specific volume begin to deviate from the expected equilibrium value. If the temperature is further lowered by a very small amount, time scales for molecular rearrangements become surprisingly long, compared to the time scale of the experimental observation. The structure of this material is almost frozen for all practical purposes and the system in this state is called <strong>glass</strong>. The system below the glass transition temperature runs out of equilibrium and it keeps on relaxing. Hence in such situation, if any property associated with the system measured, it depends on the point of time when the measurement is made. This phenomenon is called aging.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-are-glasses-so-special">
<h2><strong>Why are Glasses so Special?</strong></h2>
<p>Glasses have been one of the extensively studied systems in last few decades. This is what P. W. Anderson (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1977/">Nobel Laureate Physics 1977</a>) told about glasses:</p>
<!--  -->
<blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>"The deepest and most interesting unsolved problem in solid state theory is probably the theory of the nature of glass and the glass transition. This could be the next breakthrough in the coming decade."</dt>
<dd>-P. W. Anderson, Science (1995)</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>But even after passing more than two decades, our theoretical understanding of such systems is very much limited. This itself tells the difficulty of the problem. With the increase in computing power in last some years, it has been possible to probe much deeper in such systems. We can list some of the properties of glassy systems which are unique to them:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Near the glass transition, there is an extraordinary viscous slow-down. Computer experiments and laboratory experiments have shown that the slow-down near glass transition is related to the growth of distinct relaxing domains which we call spatial heterogeneity. The understanding of the relaxation process of each heterogeneous domain is a matter of active research.</li>
<li>The relaxation of liquid at sufficiently high temperature is observed to take place via only one mechanism but in the supercooled regime, the mechanism of relaxation can be more than one (alpha and beta relaxation).</li>
<li>Entropy crisis: Liquid has higher entropy than the corresponding crystal at the melting point. As the temperature is decreased below the melting point, the entropies of the supercooled liquid and the crystal approach one another. If this trend is extrapolated then at some nonzero temperature (called Kauzmann temperature) the liquid entropy would equal the crystal entropy. The liquid entropy would eventually become negative upon cooling because the crystal entropy approaches zero as T tends to zero (third law of thermodynamics).  But in the real situation the entropy of the liquid near glass transition does not vary too much, leading to a crisis in entropy and avoiding the counterintuitive situation of entropy becoming negative.</li>
<li>The phenomenon of aging also makes the study of glass much interesting.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="molecular-dynamics">
<h2><strong>Molecular Dynamics</strong></h2>
<p>I use the technique of molecular dynamics simulation to explore the dynamics of glasses. Molecular dynamics is one of the two important simulation techniques in statistical mechanics, another being Monte Carlo. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation model some group of particles like atoms by solving the classical equation of motion. It can give information on system dynamics at the atomic scale. With the increase in power of computers today people are using the technique of MD to model many systems. It is probably the most widely used simulation technique in condensed matter physics. In MD we model the interaction by some suitable potential like Lennard-Jones and then use some appropriate algorithm based on classical equations to evolve the system. Then many techniques are used to make the evolution fast. When system equilibrates then we do the measurement of properties which we are interested in. Sometimes I write my own code to do the MD simulation or use some software package (MD simulator) like <a class="reference external" href="http://lammps.sandia.gov/">LAMMPS</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Model Glass using Molecular Dynamics?</strong></h2>
<p>In order to model glasses in computer simulations, we consider some model glass-former which is less prone to crystallization. A very famous model glass-former is <a class="reference external" href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.51.4626">Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones mixture</a>. We then use the technique of MD simulation to explore the dynamics of model in diffrent conditions.</p>
