My Hobbies and Likes
I am fond of listening music. I like to listen to Arijit Singh, Asha Bhosle, Lata Mangeshkar, Shreya Ghoshal, Sonu Nigam and many others. Sometimes, in leisure, especially on weekend I watch movies. I love to watch Sci-Fi movies. I am very much concerned regarding the development of the country. Whenever I get the chance, try to participate in the discussion on related topics with my friends. I try to read the newspaper daily so that I could be aware what the issues going around. I am also interested in visiting places which are extraordinarily constructed by nature like waterfalls, lakes, mountains. I also prefer to visit old temples and historical places.

My Interest towards Teaching
I have been quite interested in teaching since my early days. During my secondary studies, I started to give tuitions to my juniors studying in my neighborhood. I realized teaching not only gives another opportunity to learn the subject but it also imparts confidence. So I did teaching whenever I got the chance, for fulfilling my academic and economic needs. During my undergraduation, I got a chance to teach Physics to a group of senior secondary students by associating with an organization, which helped me a lot in understanding the basics of Physics.
